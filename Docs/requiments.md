### 8. React-Router-Dom (v6):

- Utilize React-Router-Dom version 6 for client-side routing within the application.
- Implement declarative routing to navigate between different views and components efficiently.

### 9. Zod and Tanstack-React-Table:

- Integrate Zod for runtime type checking and validation of data.
- Utilize Tanstack-React-Table for displaying tabular data with features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### 10. React-Helmet-Async:

- Implement React-Helmet-Async for managing document head tags dynamically.
- Utilize this library for setting metadata, such as title, description, and other SEO-related attributes, for improved search engine optimization.

### Additional Considerations:

- Ensure compatibility and proper version management of all libraries and dependencies.
- Follow best practices for code organization, naming conventions, and documentation.
- Implement responsive design principles to ensure the application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.

### Conclusion:
